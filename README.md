# Android Testing

This project is a fake Android app that is intended to be used in workshop training to learn Android testing practices.

The Android app is based on the concept of a personal financial tracking/analysis app.  The app supports the following user journeys:

 * Login
 * Signup - personal info, selecting personal interests, and selecting credentials
 * Accounts Overview - Shows transaction lists for each of your credit cards
 * Linked Accounts - Shows a list of all bank accounts you've linked to the app
 * Link Account - Links a bank account to the app (that account will then appear in the accounts overview)
 * Credit Cards - Shows aggregate credit information across all of your linked cards
 * Analysis - Shows the amount you spend per category across all of your linked cards

The project comes with a number of pre-written tests.  These tests are mostly Espresso integration tests, but some unit tests are included as well.
